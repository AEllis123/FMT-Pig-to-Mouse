The control sample scripts used for qiime analysis and the outputs obtained from them can be found in this directory.

This directory also contains the samples collected, the manifest file, metadata file, and taxonomy outputs from the Slurm-TaxaControl job submission file. 

Alpha and Beta diversity outputs from qiime can be found in the control-core-metrics-output.

Outputs needed from the data import steps needed for analysis were copied here from the Data_Import directory. 

Control samples include positive (mock communities) and negative (NC and water) controls.
