The donor scripts used to run qiime analysis after data import and alpha rarefaction steps. Those initial steps can be found in Data_Import. These include the donor samples filtered from the original outputs to focus on the donor samples for analysis. Taxonomy outputs can be found in the directory prior to this one. Alpha and beta diversity outputs can be found in the donor-core-metrics-results in the Donor directory.
