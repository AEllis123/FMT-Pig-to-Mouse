The fecal scripts used to run qiime analysis after data import and alpha rarefaction steps. Those initial steps can be found in Data_Import. These include the fecal samples filtered from the original outputs to focus on the fecal samples for analysis. Outputs can be found in the directory prior to this one and in the fecal-core-metrics-results directory in the Fecal directory.
