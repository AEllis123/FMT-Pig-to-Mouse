This project focused on fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) from sows (n=3) and piglets (n=3) to germ free mice (n=24). Fecal samples were collected from the pigs while fecal and cecal samples were collected from the mice. Data from the importation to qiime2 step can be found in Data_Import. Data was then filtered based on if it was mouse fecal, mouse cecal, donor fecal, or a control. Each directory contains the job submission files and job outputs for that particular sample type. 
The Control directory contains the controls for this experiment. These consisted of water, NC, and mock communities. 
The Cecal directory contains the mouse cecal samples for the experiment. 
The Fecal directory contains the mouse fecal samples for the experiment. 
The Donor directory contains the donor (piglet and sow) fecal samples for the experiment.
