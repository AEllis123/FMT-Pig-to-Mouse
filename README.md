This project focused on fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) from sows (n=3) and piglets (n=3) to germ free mice (n=24). Fecal samples were collected from the pigs while fecal and cecal samples were collected from the mice. Data from the importing to qiime2 step can be found in Data_Import. Data was then filtered based on if it was fecal, cecal, or a control. Each directory contains the job submission files and job outputs for that particular sample type. 
The Control directory contains the controls for this experiment. These consisted of water, NC, and mock communities. 
The Cecal directory contains the cecal samples for the experiment. No cecal samples were collected from the donors so this set is mice only.
The fecal directory contains the fecal samples for the experiment. Donor fecal samples were also included in the fecal section.
